## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
### Continued development

Going forward, I’d like to keep practicing responsive layouts. For this project I set a fixed width for the recipe card, but in future I’ll try to make the design scale better across all screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Always a great reference for CSS and HTML properties.
- [Frontend Mentor community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - Helpful for seeing how others solved the same challenge.
